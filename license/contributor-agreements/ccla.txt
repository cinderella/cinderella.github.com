                Corporate Contributor License Agreement 

In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with 
Contributions from any corporation or other legal entity, the Cinderella 
Project (the "Project") must have a Corporate Contributor License Agreement 
("Agreement") on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating 
agreement to the license terms below. This license is for your protection 
as a Contributor as well as the protection of Cloudsoft Corporation Limited 
as Project Manager (the "Project Manager") and the Project users; it does 
not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose. 

This version of the Agreement allows an entity (the "Corporation") to 
submit Contributions to the Project Manager, to authorize Contributions 
submitted by its designated employees to the Project Manager, and to grant 
copyright and patent licenses thereto. 

   If you have not already done so, please complete and sign this 
   Corporate Contributor License Agreement by following the instructions 
   embedded below. After you fill in the required information and apply 
   your digital signature to the Agreement, the signature service will 
   generate an email to you. You must confirm your digital signature as 
   instructed in this email to complete the signing process. The signature 
   service will then send you a signed copy of this Agreement for your 
   records.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for your present 
and future Contributions submitted to the Project Manager. Except for the 
license granted herein to the Project Manager and recipients of software 
distributed by the Project Manager, You reserve all right, title, and 
interest in and to your Contributions. 

 
1. Definitions 

   "You" (or "Your") (whether or not capitalized) shall mean the copyright 
   owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making 
   this Agreement with the Project Manager. For legal entities, the entity 
   making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are 
   controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are 
   considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this 
   definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause 
   the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or 
   otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the 
   outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity. 

   "Contribution" shall mean the code, documentation or other original 
   works of authorship expressly identified in Schedule B, as well as any 
   original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to 
   an existing work, which is intentionally submitted by you to the Project 
   Manager for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the open source 
   projects owned or managed by the Project Manager (the "Work"). For the 
   purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, 
   verbal, or written communication sent to the Project Manager or its 
   representatives, including but not limited to communication on 
   electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue 
   tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Project 
   Manager for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but 
   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise 
   designated in writing by you as "Not a Contribution." 

2. Grant of Copyright License 

   Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you hereby grant 
   to the Project Manager and to recipients of software distributed by the 
   Project Manager a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, 
   royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare 
   derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and 
   distribute your Contributions and such derivative works. 

3. Grant of Patent License

   Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you hereby grant 
   to the Project Manager and to recipients of software distributed by the 
   Project Manager a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, 
   royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent 
   license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and 
   otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those 
   patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your 
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of your Contribution(s) with the 
   Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity 
   institutes patent litigation against you or any other entity (including 
   a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your 
   Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes 
   direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses 
   granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or 
   Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. 

4. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. 
   You represent further that each employee of the Corporation designated 
   on Schedule A below (or in a subsequent written modification to that 
   Schedule) is authorized to submit Contributions on behalf of the 
   Corporation. 

5. You represent that each of your Contributions is your original creation 
   (see Section 7 for submissions on behalf other others). You represent 
   that your Contribution submissions include complete details of any 
   third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, 
   related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and 
   which are associated with any part of your Contributions. 

6. You are not expected to provide support for your Contributions, except 
   to the extent you desire to provide support. You may provide support 
   for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law 
   or agreed to in writing, and except for the express licenses and 
   representations in this Agreement, you provide your Contributions on as 
   "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either 
   express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or 
   conditions of TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A 
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 

7. Should you wish to submit work that is not your original creation, you 
   may submit it to the Project Manager separately from any Contribution, 
   identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or 
   other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, 
   trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware, 
   and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a 
   third-party: [named here]". 

8. You agree to notify the Project Manager of any facts or circumstances 
   of which you become aware that would make these representations 
   inaccurate in any respect.  

9. It is your responsibility to notify the Project Manager when any change 
   is required to the list of designated employees authorized to submit 
   Contributions on behalf of the Corporation, or to the Corporation's 
   point of contact with the Project Manager.
