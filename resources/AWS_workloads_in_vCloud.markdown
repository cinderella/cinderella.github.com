Got an application you want to move from Amazon Web Services to Your vCloud?

In this session, learn how to use tools and techniques that help you accelerate the migration.
This includes EC2 API dependencies and their mappings to vCloud, and vBlob, an S3-compatible blob store that can run on any file system, developed by VMware as part of the Cloud Foundry project.
Learn how to use the vShield Edge load balancer to replace Elastic Load Balancer(ELB) and AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), and how vSphere persistent storage replaces and upgrades AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS).
