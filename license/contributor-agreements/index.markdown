The Cinderella project requires the appropriate permission to include and redistribute any contributions
as part of Cinderella, in order to protect the project and its users.

### Individual CLA

All contributors need to complete and sign the **Individual Contributor License Agreement**.
This can be done easily online:

* [Sign the Individual CLA](cla-individual.html). 

Additionally, if your work is done in a context where any organization may have rights to the contribution,
such as if you are working for a company, someone authorized by the company must
also file a Corporate Contributor License Agreement designating you by name.

### Corporate CLA

An authorized representative of a company or organization which wishes to contribute to Cinderella must file
the Corporate Contributor License Agreement and update this as there are changes to the set of employees designated to make contributions.
These actions can also be done online:

* [Sign the Corporate CLA](cla-corporate.html)
* [Update your Corporate CLA](update-corporate.html)
