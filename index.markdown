meta_description: Open source REST API for vCloud, compatible with AWS EC2 and S3.

## What is Cinderella?

The goal is to provide a REST/Query-based API for vCloud that is compatible with Amazon EC2 and S3 services. This will allow tools like [Euca2ools](https://projects.eucalyptus.com/redmine/projects/euca2ools) to interact with public or private vCloud environments by taking advantage of vCloud Director 5.1 enhancements and the [vBlob](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/vblob) project from CloudFoundry team.

## Getting Involved

The project is at a formative stage. This site hosts our design docs and instructions for getting started. [GitHub](https://github.com/cinderella/cinderella) hosts our early work outs. Community participation is critical to the success of Cinderella, so don't hesitate to [get involved]({{site.url}}/contribute/).

Got an application you want to move from Amazon Web Services to Your vCloud?

In this session, learn how to use tools and techniques that help you accelerate the migration.
This includes EC2 API dependencies and their mappings to vCloud, and vBlob, an S3-compatible blob store that can run on any file system, developed by VMware as part of the Cloud Foundry project.
Learn how to use the vShield Edge load balancer to replace Elastic Load Balancer(ELB) and AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), and how vSphere persistent storage replaces and upgrades AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS).
