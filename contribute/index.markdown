Thank you for your interest in contributing to Cinderella!

## Getting Started

GitHub hosts both [Cinderella's source](https://github.com/cinderella/cinderella) and the Cinderella website ([repo](https://github.com/cinderella/cinderella.github.com), [site](http://www.cinderella.io)).

Head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/cinderella/), download the source, have a play and issue a pull request to get your changes incorporated back into the project.

If you have never used Git or GitHub, visit [learn.github.com](http://learn.github.com/) for an introduction and tutorial.

**Remember,** you will need to sign the relevant [contributor agreement(s)]({{site.url}}/license/contributor-agreements/) before we can accept any contribution from you.
