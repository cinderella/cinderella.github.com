## What is Cinderella?

The goal is to provide a REST/Query-based API for vCloud that is compatible with Amazon EC2 and S3 services. This will allow tools like [Euca2ools](https://projects.eucalyptus.com/redmine/projects/euca2ools) to interact with public or private vCloud environments by taking advantage of vCloud Director 5.1 enhancements and the [vBlob](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/vblob) project from CloudFoundry team.

## Getting Involved
